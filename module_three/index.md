title: Module 3 Career Development
---

## Overview
Module 3 Career Development is focused on **executing the strategies** that students have been building in the previous two modules. Prior to Mod 3, students will have created their career visions and started to build job search strategies aligned with those visions. In Mod 3, students have the opportunity to put these ideas into practice through weekly workshops, discussions, and optional self-reflection in their career journals.  

### Key Learning Goals
Core Competencies of Module 3:
* Self-awareness
* Self-reflection
* Putting effective habits into place
* Professional storytelling through tools such as resumes, cover letters, and online portfolios
* Executing effective job search strategies
* Best practices for outreach and networking on job applications
* Best practices for interviewing for technical jobs

### Module 3 Outcomes
At the end of Module 3, students should have:  

- [ ] Resume draft reviewed by CV Compiler
- [ ] Resume reviewed by peer
- [ ] Turing alumni portfolio completed and published
- [ ] Peer review of a cover letter
- [ ] An outlined strategy for their job search
- [ ] Conducted outreach with at least 1 contact at a company student is targeting

In Module 4, they will continue to refine each of these items to execute their job search strategy.

### Career Journal
Students will engage in self-reflection and ideation in their career journals every week during a module.

**What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way!
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout each module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time.
* **Module Expectations.** Career journals are optional to complete. The Career Development team has seen that students who engage in the self-reflection of the journals are often hired more quickly because of the time they invest into creating their job search strategy, but we do not require students to complete journals. Instead, we'll read career journals upon request to provide specific feedback and customized support. 

#### Set Up
Students will create their career journals in Mod 0 and submit them as part of their career development prework. [Here is the Module 3 set of career journal prompts](/module_three/mod3_career_journal_prompts). For all journal responses, students have the option to submit a video or audio recording instead of a written response. We recommend using YouTube or Vimeo for these recordings and including the links in their journals. If you have any questions on this, please reach out to a member of the Career Dev team. In addition, [here is a template for how you can organize all of your career journal responses](/career_journals/career_journal_template). 

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 3, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. They should continue to further their career development goals throughout the module, [following these guidelines and prompts for their career journals](/module_three/m3_repeat_plan). The Career Development team will check in with repeating students to provide guidance and answer questions.
