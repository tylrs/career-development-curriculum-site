title: Module 2 Career Development
---

## Overview
Module 2 Career Development is focused on **building on one's initial career vision** established in Module 1, which asks students to focus on building their professional story and brand through tools like LinkedIn, create initial strategies for the job search based on their vision, and begin networking in order to learn more about this career and expand their idea of what they want it to be. Students will engage in activities to build on their initial career visions through weekly workshops, discussions, and optional self-reflection in their career journals.  

### Key Learning Goals
Core Competencies of Module 2:
* Self-awareness shown through ability to express one's strengths, values, and professional goals
* Build on effective habits
* Decrease ineffective habits
* Create and follow through on effective job search strategies
* Best practices for building one's professional network

### Module 2 Outcomes
At the end of Module 2, students should have:  

- [ ] A professional story draft that articulates their career vision
- [ ] LinkedIn profile updated and reviewed by a member of the Career Development team
- [ ] Conducted outreach with at least 1 contact for career research purposes

### Career Journal
Students will engage in self-reflection and ideation in their career journals every week during a module.

**What is a career journal?** The journal will help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals.  It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.   
* **Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Just don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way!
* **Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout each module, you'll respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time.
* **Module Expectations.** Career journals are optional to complete. The Career Development team has seen that students who engage in the self-reflection of the journals are often hired more quickly because of the time they invest into creating their job search strategy, but we do not require students to complete journals. Instead, we'll read career journals upon request to provide specific feedback and customized support. 

#### Set Up
Students will create their career journals in Mod 0 and submit them as part of their career development prework. [Here is the Module 2 set of career journal prompts](/module_two/mod2_career_journal_prompts). For all journal responses, students have the option to submit a video or audio recording instead of a written response. We recommend using YouTube or Vimeo for these recordings and including the links in their journals. If you have any questions on this, please reach out to a member of the Career Dev team. In addition, [here is a template for how you can organize all of your career journal responses](/career_journals/career_journal_template). 

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 2, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. They should continue to further their career development goals throughout the module, [following these guidelines and prompts for their career journals](/module_two/m2_pd_repeat_plan). The Career Development team will check in with repeating students to provide guidance and answer questions.
