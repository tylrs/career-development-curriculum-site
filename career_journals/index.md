title: Career Journals

## Overview
Students have the opportunity to engage in self-reflection and ideation through career journals every week during a module.

**What is a career journal?** The journal is a tool that can help guide you through the process of discovering who you are as a new developer and how that translates into your career goals. It’s a way to check in with yourself through self-reflection, prompts, and questions, organize your targeted job search, and remember who you met as you build a professional network.

**Make it your own.** Add questions and areas to reflect on each week. Don’t forget to share all of your successes and achievements along the way!

**Ongoing progress checks.** Throughout each module, you'll have the opportunity to respond to the other prompts and update your progress in your document during professional development workshops and set aside work time.

**Module Expectations.** Career journals are optional to complete. The Career Development team has seen that students who engage in the self-reflection of the journals are often hired more quickly because of the time they invest into creating their job search strategy, but we do not require students to complete journals. Instead, we'll read career journals upon request to provide specific feedback and customized support. 

## Template
