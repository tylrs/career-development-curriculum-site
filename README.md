# Career Development Curriculum

Turing’s **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. 

Turing’s career development curriculum is created directly out of this mission with a focus on **unlocking students’ potential** in modules one and two through cultivating self-awareness and empathy. In modules three and four, curriculum focuses on providing strategies to empower students to **succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers** by creating connections within the technology industry, building competencies for industry leadership, and securing a fulfilling career -- and not just another job. 

The touchstones of this curriculum include developing these mindsets: 

* **Agency:** Taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work
* **Empathy:** Understanding and sharing others' emotions in order to relate to them 
* **Engagement:** Active participation in community
* **Grit:** A combination of perseverance and passion
* **Growth:** A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency

### Structure of Career Development
Each week, students will have a workshop on a specific professional development topic to provide them with support in each of these areas. The workshops will provide space for whole group and small group discussion, readings, and reflection time along with resources and strategies for implementing new ideas. 

Throughout the rest of the week, students will be able to put this learning into practice through reflections in their career journals. What is a career journal?  It's a document where the student can create a road map for their career goals through self-reflection, prompts, and questions. While this document is optional to complete, we've found that students who engage in the journal reflection process find jobs more quickly than students who don't. 

The Career Dev team can review journal reflections when requested by students to provide tailored support when needed.
